### Gesture-Based Presentation Controller

This project implements a basic gesture-based presentation controller in Java. The program allows users to control a presentation using simple gestures such as "next", "previous", and "stop". It provides a command-line interface where users can input their gestures to navigate through the slides of a presentation.

### Features:

- **Next Slide**: Advances to the next slide in the presentation.
- **Previous Slide**: Goes back to the previous slide in the presentation.
- **Stop Presentation**: Stops the presentation.

### How to Use:

1. Compile the Java file: `javac GesturePresentationController.java`
2. Run the compiled program: `java GesturePresentationController`
3. Follow the prompts and enter gestures to control the presentation.

### Example Usage:

```
Gesture Presentation Controller

Enter gesture (next/previous/stop): next
Next slide

Enter gesture (next/previous/stop): previous
Previous slide

Enter gesture (next/previous/stop): stop
Presentation stopped

```

### Dependencies:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Note:

- This is a basic implementation intended for educational purposes. Actual gesture recognition would require specialized hardware or software libraries.
